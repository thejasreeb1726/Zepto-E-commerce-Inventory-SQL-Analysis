## üìä Project Workflow

### üîπ 1. Table Creation  
Created a structured PostgreSQL table with correct data types for each column.

### üîπ 2. Data Import  
Used `\copy` in pgAdmin to import the UTF-8 formatted CSV file.

### üîπ 3. Data Exploration  
- Viewed first few rows and structure  
- Counted in-stock vs out-of-stock items  
- Found nulls and zero-price anomalies  
- Explored category-level product counts

### üîπ 4. Data Cleaning  
- Removed records where MRP or selling price = 0  
- Converted paise to ‚Çπ for better readability  
- Checked and handled inconsistent quantity fields

### üîπ 5. Business-Oriented SQL Queries  
- Top 10 products with highest discounts  
- Out-of-stock products with highest MRP  
- Estimated revenue potential by product category  
- Average discount per category  
- Price per gram analysis to detect value-for-money products  
- Total inventory weight grouped by category  
- Classified products into weight buckets (Low, Medium, Bulk)
